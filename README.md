# Excel-Malware-Maverick

This project explores how MS Excel can be used to download and execute malware.

The VBA code does the following:

When the Excel workbook is opened:
1. It checks if Microsoft Excel is already running.
2. If Excel is not running, it starts a new instance of Excel.
3. It then downloads the malware (firstStageMal.exe) from the specified URL.
4. The downloaded file is saved to a temporary location on the user's computer.
5. Finally, it runs the downloaded exe (firstStageMal.exe) file.

This code assumes firstStageMal.exe is hosted in a Python HTTP server. You can modify the code according to your requirements.

If you are using O365, make sure to Enable VBA Macros.
